== NAME

rigctl-jtdx - Hamlib 3 rigctld server.

== SYNOPSIS

*rigctl-jtdx* [OPTIONS]

== DESCRIPTION

*jtdx* uses a version of the *hamlib* CAT control library.  This
 library is heavily modified over the current release version of
 *hamlib*. If a *jtdx* user wishes to use the *hamlib* network rig
 server *rigctld* to remotely control their transceiver; then this
 special version of the *rigctl* client should be used since that too
 has the modified *hamlib* code embedded with it.
