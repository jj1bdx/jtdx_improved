=== Help with Setup

_WSJT-X_ is the {wsjt_yahoo_group} at email address
wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com.  The chances are good that someone with
similar interests and equipment has already solved your problem and
will be happy to help.

=== Bug Reports

One of your responsibilities as a _WSJT-X_ user is to help the
volunteer programmers to make the program better.  Bugs may be
reported to {wsjt_yahoo_group} (email address
wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com) or the WSJT Developers list
(wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net).  To be useful, bug reports should
include at least the following information:

- Program version
- Operating system
- Concise description of the problem
- Exact sequence of steps required to reproduce the problem

=== Feature Requests

Suggestions from users often result in new program features.  Good
ideas are always welcome: if there's a feature you would like to see
in _WSJT-X_, spell it out in as much detail as seems useful and send
it to us at one the the email addresses given a few lines above.  Be
sure to explain why you think the feature is desirable, and what sort
of other users might find it so.
