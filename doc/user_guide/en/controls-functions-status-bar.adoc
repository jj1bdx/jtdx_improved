A *Status Bar* at the bottom edge of the main window provides
information about operating conditions.

Labels on the *Status Bar* display such information as the program's
current operating state, operating mode, the content of your most
recent transmitted message, and whether *Double-click on call sets Tx
enable* has been selected on the *Settings | General* tab. The first
label (operating state) can be Receiving, Tx (for Transmitting), Tune,
or the name of file opened from the *File* menu; this label is
highlighted in green for Receiving, yellow for Tx, and red for Tune.
When transmitting, the Tx message is displayed exactly as it will be
decoded by receiving stations.
