At the center of the main window are a number of controls used when
making QSOs:

* Check *Tx even* to transmit in even-numbered UTC minutes.  Uncheck
this box to transmit in the odd minutes.  This selection is made
automatically when you double-click on a decoded text line, as
described in the <<TUTORIAL,Basic Operating Tutorial>>.

* The Tx and Rx audio frequencies are usually set automatically by
double-clicking on decoded text or a signal in the waterfall.  They 
can also be adjusted with spinner controls. 

* You can force Tx frequency to the current Rx frequency by clicking
the *Tx<Rx* button, and vice-versa for *Rx<Tx*.  Check the box *Lock
Tx=Rx* to make the frequencies always track one another.  The
on-the-air frequency of your lowest JT9 or JT65 tone is the sum of
dial frequency and audio Tx frequency.

IMPORTANT: In general we do not recommend using *Lock Tx=Rx* since it
encourages poor radio etiquette when running a frequency.  With *Lock
Tx=Rx* checked, your own Tx frequency will move around following your
callers.

* The *Report* control lets you change a signal report that has been
inserted automatically. Most reports will fall in the range â€“26 to +10
dB.  Remember that JT65 reports saturate at an upper limit of -1
dB.

IMPORTANT: Consider reducing power if your QSO partner reports your
signal above -5 dB.  The WSJT modes are supposed to be weak signal
modes!
