- Select *WSPR-2* from the *Mode* menu.  The main window will
reconfigure itself to the WSPR interface, removing some controls not
used in WSPR mode.

- Configure the Wide Graph as suggested in the screen shot below.

- Use the mouse to set the width and height of the main window as
desired.

- Select an active WSPR frequency (for example, 10.1387 MHz).

- Click *Monitor* to start a WSPR receiving period.

- If you will be transmitting as well as receiving, select a suitable
value for *Tx Pct* (average percentage of 2-minute sequences devoted to
transmitting) and activate the *Enable Tx* button.

- Select your Tx power (in dBm) from the drop-down list.

=== Band Hopping
WSPR mode allows those with CAT-controlled radios to investigate
propagation on many bands without user intervention.  Coordinated
hopping enables a sizable group of stations around the world to move
together from band to band, thereby maximizing the chances of
identifying open propagation paths.

- To enable automatic band-hopping, check the *Band Hopping* box on
the main window.

- Click *Schedule* to open the *WSPR Band Hopping* window, and select
the bands you wish to use at each time of day.

- Band-switching occurs after each 2-minute interval.  Preferred bands
are identified with time slots in a repeating 20-minute cycle,
according to the following table:

|Band:            |160|80|60|40|30|20|17|15|12|10
.3+|*UTC minute:* | 00|02|04|06|08|10|12|14|16|18
                 >| 20|22|24|26|28|30|32|34|36|38
                 >| 40|42|44|46|48|50|52|54|56|58

- If the preferred band is not active according to your band-hopping
schedule, a band will be selected at random from among the active
bands.

- If the box labeled *Tune* is checked for a particular band, _WSJT-X_
transmits an unmodulated carrier for several seconds just after
switching to that band and before the normal Rx or Tx period
starts. This feature can be used to activate an automatic antenna
tuner (ATU) to tune a multi-band antenna to the newly selected band.

- Depending on your station and antenna setup, band changes might
require other switching besides retuning your radio. To make this
possible in an automated way, whenever _WSJT-X_ executes a successful
band-change command to a CAT-controlled radio, it looks for a file
named +user_hardware.bat+, +user_hardware.cmd+, +user_hardware.exe+,
or +user_hardware+ in the working directory. If one of these is found,
_WSJT-X_ tries to execute the command

 user_hardware nnn 

- In the above command +nnn+ is the band-designation wavelength in
meters. You will need to write your own program, script, or batch file
to do the necessary switching at your station.
