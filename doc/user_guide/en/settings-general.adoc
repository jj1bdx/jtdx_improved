Select the *General* tab on the *Settings* window.  Under _Station
Details_, enter your call sign and 4-digit or 6-digit grid locator.
This information will be sufficient for initial tests.

Meanings of remaining options on the *General* tab should be
self-explanatory after you have made some QSOs using _WSJT-X_.  You
may return to set these options to your preferences later.  

IMPORTANT: If you are using a callsign with an add-on prefix or
suffix, or wish to work a station using such a call, be sure to read
the section <<COMP-CALL,Compound Callsigns>>.
