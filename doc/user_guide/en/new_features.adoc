=== New in Version 1.6

For quick reference, here's a short list of features and capabilities
added to _WSJT-X_ since Version 1.5.0:

- *WSPR* mode, including coordinated automatic band-hopping and a
new two-pass decoder that can decode overlapping signals.

- EME-motivated features including *JT4* (submodes *A-G*), *Echo*
mode, and automatic *Doppler tracking*.  The JT4 decoder is more
sensitive than that in the latest WSJT, and message averaging is fully
automated.  (Note that submodes *JT65B* and *JT65C* are also present
in Version 1.6, but the high-sensitivity decoder required for EME with
JT65 is not yet included.)

- Tools for accurate *frequency calibration* of your radio, so you can
be always on-frequency to within about 1 Hz.

- Mode-specific standard working frequencies accessible from the
drop-down band selector.

- A number of corrections to the Hamlib library, fixing balky
rig-control features.  A few unreliable features peculiar to
particular radios have been removed.

=== Future releases

Much work has already been done on Version 1.7 of _WSJT-X_.  (Up to
now this branch has been called v1.6.1.)  More than 100 people have
been building this version for themselves as development progresses,
and reporting on their experiences.  The next release will offer
several "`fast modes`" intended for meteor and ionospheric scatter,
including a new FEC-enhanced mode called *JTMSK*.  It will also have a
significantly improved JT65 decoder, especially advantageous when used
in crowded HF bands.  Starting with Version 1.7, _WSJT-X_ will no
longer use the patented, closed-source Koetter-Vardy algorithm.
