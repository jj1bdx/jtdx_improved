<<TUT_MAIN,Sections 6.1>> through <<TUT_EX2,6.4>> cover basic
operation for making two-way QSOs with modes JT9 and JT65 on the HF
bands.  <<WSPR,Section 7>> covers WSPR mode, and 
<<VHF_AND_UP,Section 8>> covers VHF+ features.  If you are a new 
user of _WSJT-X_ we suggest that you go through the full HF-oriented 
tutorial while at your radio.  It should take no more than 20 minutes.
If your main interests are WSPR of VHF+, you may then proceed to 
Sections 7 and 8.
