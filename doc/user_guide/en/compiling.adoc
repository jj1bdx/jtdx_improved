// Status=review
// Note to developers. The URL http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/. is
// to a very old src version of WSJT 5.7 or so. WSJTX is not listed at all.
// Also, all the Qt4 stuff is now obsolete, and needs to be updated.

// Web Links
// Source File is: dev-guide/source/wsjtx-dev/wsjtx-dev.adoc
// At some point, compiling_wsjtx_linux.html needs a name change to: wsjtx-dev.html
// These files can only be built on Linux, due to source-highlight being removed
// From the windows build batch file.

A Developer's Guide for WSJT and its sister programs is itself under
development.  The present draft contains full instructions for
compiling _WSJT-X_ in Linux, and an outline of steps required in
Windows.
