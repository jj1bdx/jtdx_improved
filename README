JTDX is forked from  WSJT-X, a computer  program  dedicated to amateur
radio communication using very weak signals. 

The program runs equally well on Windows, Macintosh and Linux systems,
and installation packages are available for all three platforms.

JTDX  is  an  open-source project released under the  GPL license (See
COPYING). If  you have  programming or  documentation skills  or would
like to  contribute to  the project  in other  ways, please  make your
interests known  to the  development team.
